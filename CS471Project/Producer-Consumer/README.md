## Description
This program uses Pthreads to solve the producer-consumer problem. This program is written in C++. The program will take an input file with a few lines of data to compute the turnaround time.

## Input Files
The program will take three seperate files containing 12 producers and 12 consumers in each file. The files included are:
*input-2sec-wait.txt
*input-4sec-wait.txt
*input-6sec-wait.txt
Each file has a column with sleep times matching the #sec in their names.

## Compiling The Program
